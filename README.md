# Infewence
A Rust implementation of Algorithm W, which is a type inference algorithm for the Hindley-Milner type-system. The code is rather unidiomatic and uses copius amounts of `.clone()` as the main inspiration was the Haskell implementation detailed in [Algorithm W Step By Step](https://github.com/yairchu/Algorithm-W-Step-By-Step/blob/master/AlgorithmW.pdf)
